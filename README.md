# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
We are assisting a Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom with an election audit of tabulated results for US congressional precinct in Colorado. We are to use Python to automate the audit process to find:

1. Total number of votes cast.
2. Candidates who received votes.
3. Total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determining the winner of the election based on popular vote. 


## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv

Software: Python 3.10.5, Visual Studio Code, 1.68

## Election Audit Summary
Python allows analyst to cycle through large sets of data by recycling scripts of code, providing the ease of automation for projects similar to this Election Audit. This script can not only be used for this Colorado U.S. Congresssional Precinct audit, but for numerous other elections as well, local or even on much larger scales. Modifying Python scripts to add more candidates or counties, or even change them to states is all entirely possible with the ease of automation in which Python provides. 

We could modify the script to produce results by state or have the code print out more candidates. Another example of a script modification could be separating different types of ballots that come in: printing out the total count of each ballot category as well as the percentage of the total count. Evaluating it even deeper could have us anaylze it by state, county, candidate, etc. Regardless, the ease at which the Python script provides can be used on any scale and should be considered as a tool used more widely throughout.
